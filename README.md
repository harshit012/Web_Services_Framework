# Web-Services-Framework
This is the java based Web Services Framework, which provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and create the backend/serverside of the web-application. Now the user do not need to worry about servlets or the configuration of web.xml anymore. 

# Why to use this framework?
* No need to write the code for servlet classes.
* The framework generates a javascript file, Which contains the necessary implementation of all the service classes at backend/serverside.
* No need to do url mappings in XML file. (deployment descriptor)
* User don't need to worry about GET/POST request and how to Handle them.
* The user can easily send/receive the data from client-side to server-side without writing the single line of code of JSON parsing.
